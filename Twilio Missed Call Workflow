## Twilio Missed Call Automation (Personal Project)

This repository documents a personal automation workflow built using Twilio Voice and Messaging APIs.

The goal of this project is to:
- Detect missed inbound phone calls
- Automatically trigger follow-up SMS messages
- Capture lead information
- Route conversations into an automated workflow for scheduling or follow-up

This project is designed for learning and experimentation while building real-world automation systems using Twilio APIs, workflow orchestration tools, and AI agents.

No unsolicited or spam messaging is sent. All messages are transactional or user-initiated.
